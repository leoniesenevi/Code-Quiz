The application was built as part of a project for the UNC Coding bootcamp program. 
The quiz is multiple-choice and relies on a timer to determine how well the user performs when taking the quiz. 
The timer starts after the start button is clicked. Starting at and counting down from 75 seconds,
 if time the user submits the wrong answer, 15 seconds (also later saved as the user's score) are deducted from the countdown clock. 
The application also uses local storage to store the user's score to the browser so that when the user returns, they can track pervious quiz attempts and try to beat their high score.


The program is written in vanilla JavaScript.

A timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side
Functional, deployed application. The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.
 Clicking the start button displays a series of questions. Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.
 If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.
 The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0. 
After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.

No installation necessary. Project is hosted here:https://leoniesenevi.github.io/Code-Quiz/
